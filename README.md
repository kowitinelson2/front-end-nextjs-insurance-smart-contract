Front end of the insurance smart contract 

Insurance Smart Contract Front End

This project is a front-end application built using Next.js for interacting with an insurance smart contract. It provides three pages: one for the insurance company, one for the validator, and one for the insured.

Features

Insurance Company Page: 

This page allows the insurance company to create and manage insurance policies. They can add new policies, view existing policies, and update policy details.

Validator Page: 

The validator page is designed for the validator role in the insurance contract. Validators can review and approve policies submitted by the policyholder. 

Insured Page: 

The insured page provides an interface for policyholders to view their insurance policies, make payment of premiums, and make claims if needed.
