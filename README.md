Front end of the insurance smart contract 

Insurance Smart Contract Front End

This project is a front-end application built using Next.js for interacting with an insurance smart contract. It provides three pages: one for the insurance company, one for the validator, and one for the insured.

Features

Insurance Company Page: 

This page allows the insurance company to create and manage insurance policies. They can add new policies, view existing policies, and update policy details.

Validator Page: 

The validator page is designed for the validator role in the insurance contract. Validators can review and approve policies submitted by the policyholder. 

Insured Page: 

The insured page provides an interface for policyholders to view their insurance policies, make payment of premiums, and make claims if needed.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
